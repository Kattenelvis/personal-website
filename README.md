# My Personal website :D

Welcome to my personal website, check out the current deployment at https://kattenelvis.netlify.app/ (Will put it up on my own URL later).

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm ci` start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy the app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
