	From the fruitiger aero page on the aesthethics wiki:
	<blockquote>
		Frutiger Aero (also known as Web 2.0 Gloss) is a design aesthetic that was prevalent from
		roughly 2005 to 2013, succeeding Y2K Futurism and overlapping with the Frutiger Metro and
		Recession Pop aesthetics. It is characterized by its use of skeuomorphism, glossy textures,
		cloudy skies, tropical fish, water, bubbles, glass, lens flare, sprawling patterns, "humanism",
		aero glass, bokeh, Frutiger fonts, abstract tech, auroras, and bright, vibrant colors (typically
		white, green, and blue). The aesthetic's timeline coincides with the early days of Web 2.0 and
		the transition from feature phones to smartphones.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		This aesthetic was originally unnamed; at the time, its visual elements were often associated
		with specific hardware and software elements depicted in box art and promotional material (e.g.
		Windows Aero, iOS's skeuomorphic icons, and the visuals of Mirror's Edge and Spore) rather than
		a broader aesthetic. While some referred to the glossy elements as "Web 2.0 Gloss" during its
		mainstream period, this term described a specific aspect of Frutiger Aero rather than the
		aesthetic as a whole. Frutiger Aero encompasses many subgenres and related aesthetics, including
		Frutiger Metro, Technozen, and Frutiger Eco.
