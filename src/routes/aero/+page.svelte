			Frutiger Aero (also known as Web 2.0 Gloss) is a design aesthetic that was prevalent from
			roughly 2005 to 2013, succeeding Y2K Futurism and overlapping with the Frutiger Metro and
			Recession Pop aesthetics. It is characterized by its use of skeuomorphism, glossy textures,
			cloudy skies, tropical fish, water, bubbles, glass, lens flare, sprawling patterns,
			"humanism", aero glass, bokeh, Frutiger fonts, abstract tech, auroras, and bright, vibrant
			colors (typically white, green, and blue). The aesthetic's timeline coincides with the early
			days of Web 2.0 and the transition from feature phones to smartphones.

			This aesthetic was originally unnamed; at the time, its visual elements were often associated
			with specific hardware and software elements depicted in box art and promotional material
			(e.g. Windows Aero, iOS's skeuomorphic icons, and the visuals of Mirror's Edge and Spore)
			rather than a broader aesthetic. While some referred to the glossy elements as "Web 2.0 Gloss"
			during its mainstream period, this term described a specific aspect of Frutiger Aero rather
			than the aesthetic as a whole. Frutiger Aero encompasses many subgenres and related
			aesthetics, including Frutiger Metro, Technozen, and Frutiger Eco.
